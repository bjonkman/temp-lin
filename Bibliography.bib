  abstract = {Because of its versatility in analyzing a broad range of applications, multibody dynamics has grown in the past two decades to be an important tool for designing, prototyping, and simulating complex articulated mechanical systems. This textbook-a result of the author's many years of research and teaching-brings together diverse concepts of dynamics, combining the efforts of many researchers in the field of mechanics. Bridging the gap between dynamics and engineering applications such as microrobotics, virtual reality simulation of interactive mechanical systems, nanomechanics, flexible biosystems, crash simulation, and biomechanics, the book puts into perspective the importance of modeling in the dynamic simulation and solution of problems in these fields. To help engineering students and practicing engineers understand the rigid-body dynamics concepts needed for the book, the author presents a compiled overview of particle dynamics and Newton's second law of motion in the first chapter. A particular strength of the work is its use of matrices to generate kinematic coefficients associated with the formulation of the governing equations of motion. Additional features of the book include: * numerous worked examples at the end of each section * introduction of boundary-element methods (BEM) in the description of flexible systems * up-to-date solution techniques for rigid and flexible multibody dynamics using finite- element methods (FEM) * inclusion of MATLAB-based simulations and graphical solutions * in-depth presentation of constrained systems * presentation of the general form of equations of motion ready for computer implementation * two unique chapters on stability and linearization of the equations of motion Junior/senior undergraduates and first-year graduate engineering students taking a course in dynamics, physics, control, robotics, or biomechanics will find this a useful book with a strong computer orientation towards the subject. The work may also be used as a slf-study resource or research reference for practitioners in the above-mentioned fields. © 2006 Birkhäuser Boston.},

  abstract = {The finite element absolute nodal coordinate formulation is used in this investigation to study the centrifugal stiffening effect on rotating two-dimensional beams. It is demonstrated that the geometric stiffening effect can be automatically accounted for in the above mentioned finite element formulation by using an expression for the elastic forces obtained with a general continuum mechanics approach. The Hill equation that governs the vibration of the rotating beam is obtained in terms of a set of generalized coordinates that describe the beam displacements and slopes. Under the assumption of small deformation, the Hill equation is linearized, and the complete solution is obtained and used to demonstrate analytically that such a solution does not exhibit instabilities as the angular velocity of the beam increases. The results obtained using this finite element procedure are compared with the results reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {Geometric, rotational or dynamic stiffening is a well and long known phenomenon in the analysis of flexible bodies.  In multibody dynamics the effect has attracted attention only recently.  The objective of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the modelling of geometric stiffening in multibody system simulation.  Today's methods for modelling the effect assume that the (applied) stresses in a flexible system body are zero in its reference configuration, in which it performs large overall motions.  The corresponding inertial loads are shown to be balanced by constraint stresses.  This can be seen easily when formulating the system equations of motion for non-zero reference stresses.  As a result one obtains an efficient alternative to compute the geometric stiffening terms.  The method increases the generality of flexible body models for multibody system simulation.},
